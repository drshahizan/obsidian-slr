[The Systematic Review Accelerator (SRA)](https://sr-accelerator.com/) is a suite of automation tools, purpose-built to speed up multiple steps in the systematic review process. A systematic review is a type of research that summarizes and synthesizes all the relevant studies on a specific topic or question.

The SRA project is based at the Bond University Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare and aims to reduce the amount of time it takes to construct a systematic review without impacting quality. The SRA tools are freely available for anyone in the world to use. Some of the tools are:

- Polyglot: A tool that can translate a search query from one database to another, such as from PubMed to Embase or from Cochrane Library to Web of Science. This can save time and ensure consistency when searching for studies across different databases.
- Deduplication: A tool that can detect and remove duplicate references from a set of search results. This can reduce the workload and improve the accuracy of screening studies for inclusion or exclusion.
- Word Frequency Analyser: A tool that can analyse the frequency of words and phrases in a set of search results. This can help with developing and refining a search strategy and identifying relevant keywords and synonyms.
- Hotkey: A tool that can assign keyboard shortcuts to common actions in EndNote, such as marking references as included or excluded, adding notes, or moving references to different groups. This can speed up the screening process and reduce mouse clicks.
